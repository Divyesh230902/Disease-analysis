problem statement :

    --> Dataset Understanding:
            dataset.csv <- In this dataset "Disease" & it's "Symptoms" are listed.
            symptom_Description <- In this dataset "Description" of Disease is given.

            Symptom-severity <- In this dataset "Severity" on the scale of 1-7 is given.

    --> Now in this set of dataset we have to analyze that which disease has common symptoms and the scale of severity of that disease should be taken out for further analysis, for the end user there should be a input option of symptoms and the model should classify the disease with it's description and precations.
    
    --> Every dataset has it's own properties so that, the final dataset from which the data to user has to be shown must be clear and understandable.
